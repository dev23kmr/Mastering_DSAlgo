BigInteger Property

It is used when mathimatical calculation that goes outside the limit of primitive data type.
In BigInteger memory are allocated dynamically and we can store value  as large as we want.
Practically memory is limited so we can store Integer.MAX_VALUE number of bits in it.

Eg: BigInteger bigValue = new BigInteger.valueOf(739420);
OR  BigInteger bigValue = new BigInteger.valueOf("890232903");

byte	1 byte	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short	2 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
int  	4 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long	8 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	4 bytes	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double	8 bytes	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits

Integer.MAX_VALUE = (2 power 31) - 1
Integer.MIN_VALUE = -(2 power 31)
